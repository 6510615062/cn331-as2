## For users

We've built a quota registration system using Django framework.

The web-application contains 3 html page: sign-in, sign-up and dashboard.

The web-application has a default url set to the sign in page.

Users can redirect to the sign up page and enter information to create an account.

After signing up the website redirect user to sign in again.

After user sign in, the website will redirect user to dashboard page.

The dashboard is inaccessible without signing in.

The dashboard page contains three main elements:
- your registered course table at the top (maximum of 7 courses)
    * click button "delete" to withdraw registered course 
- search bar
    * using course ID to search
- table containg all courses
    * with filtering button to see course open for registration (Status = Open)

A sign-out button at the top right corner.

Dark mode/ Light mode switch icon on the navigation bar.
